In order to combine Kaleu with Alpgen, you need to edit some source
files of Alpgen. In the directory to_alpgen_dir you will find the
result of

diff -C 1 original new

for the files that have to be changed. You will notice that you only
have to add lines, all marked with !KALEU (except for the makefile,
in which you have to edit one line). Realize that the input then
needs one extra integer on the line labeled by

! N(events)/iteration and N(iter's) for initial grid optimiz

which you have to put to 1 if you want to use Kaleu.
So far, only the 2Q and 4Q processes have been included, and only
to the level of cross section calculation.
