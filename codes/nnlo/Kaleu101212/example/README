This is an example of the use of Kaleu in a Monte Carlo program. The
files kaleu_* in this directory are going to be part of the Kaleu
library for the specific application in this example. They are supposed
to be written by the user of Kaleu.

There is a toy amplitude calculator "ToyAmp" in this example.

Put the correct fortran compiler in the script file "all.sh", and
execute it.
Then, you can edit the input, and execute "./montecarlo.exe < input"

For the example of Kaleu with dipole channels, you put the correct
fortran compiler in the script file "allNLO.sh", and execute that
one.
Then, you edit inputNLO, and execute "./montecarloNLO.exe < inputNLO"

If you do not touch the libraries of Kaleu or ToyAmp anymore, you can
from now on just "make" or "make -f makefileNLO" if you change
something.
